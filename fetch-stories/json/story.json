My dad doesn’t speak Korean at home, and my mom doesn’t speak Ilonggo. Our parents never taught my brothers or me these languages because they’re both fluent in English, so there was no need to. Not being able to speak either of these languages distances myself from the two cultures even further. Communicating with my grandma on my dad’s side is difficult, since she knows English but doesn’t speak it well. Unfortunately, this language barrier makes me feel less Korean. I know that languages I can or cannot speak don’t define who I am, but then again, language is a huge part of culture and can give you a sense of belonging, wherever you are. Visiting my dad’s side of the family, I never felt isolated, but I never felt like I truly belonged. I’m still juggling with these ideas in my head, but I’m fortunate to where I feel accepted in both my family and community.” — Isabel Suh, 9"

A samba school is composed of a collaboration of local neighbours that want to attend the carnival together, with some kind of regional, geographical and common background."

Translating dokkaebi into the English word “goblin” can lead to misconceptions because in European folklore, goblins have a demonic or evil element to them; whereas dokkaebi do not.  Dokkaebi are creatures with supernatural powers and skills and have both negative and positive characteristics; they generally take pleasure in making humans happy, but at times are known to bring misery.  The role of dokkaebi in Korean folklore can’t be overstated – let’s put it this way: dokkaebi is to Koreans as leprechauns are to the Irish. The first written story of dokkaebi appeared in the Samguk Yusa (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms) in the tale “Lady Dohwa and Bachelor Bihyeong” 도화녀 비형랑 which takes place during the Silla dynasty. This tale is considered to be the first documented narrative of dokkaebi."
